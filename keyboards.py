"""
Define inline keyboard options for each stage here.
Every keyboard defined should be in a list or tuple.
Nested lists are allowed.

*_raw / _* keyboards are each a dict mapping the keyboard text to a callback query code.
This is used for cases where the same keyboard option leads to a different callback stage.

Class for Keyboard is declared here. Used for ease of setting up the InlineKeyboard for each stage.
